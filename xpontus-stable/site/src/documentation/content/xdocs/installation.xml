			<title>Using the cross-platform installer</title>
			<p>You can run the installer by double-clicking on it. If jars files arent' associated

			<title>Using the Unix installer</title>
			<p>The installer is a self extracting archive</p>
			<p>It is the same as the cross-platform installer but you don't need to run the java command</p>
			<p>If you are using gnome, kde or xfce, open your file explorer and change the installer file permissions to make it executable. After that, double-click on the installer and choose to run it.</p>
			<p>If you are using a simple window manager like fluxbox, etc. or because you just want to use the console run the following commands </p>
			<source>
chmod +x XPontusInstaller-version.sh;
sh ./XPontusInstaller-version.sh;			
			</source>
