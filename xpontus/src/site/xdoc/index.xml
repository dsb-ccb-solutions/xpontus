            <p>XPontus XML Editor is a simple XML Editor oriented towards text editing. It can perform validation, XSL transformations(HTML, XML, PDF, SVG), schema/DTD generation, DTD/HTML/XSL completion, code formatting and much <a href="featureshtml">more</a>.
            New brand new version is plugin based to solve some limitation issues.
            XPontus aims to become "the" free alternative to
            commercial XML IDES such as XMLSPy or Oxygen XML Editor, or Exchanger XML Editor without the "Entreprise features" for now.</p>        
            <p>XPontus tries to provide you the features you would expect of a real XML IDE in a familiar and conviviable manner.</p>
