            <title>Who am I?</title>
            <p>My name is Yves Zoundi and I come from <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso" class="fork">Burkina Faso</a>.
                I work as a programer analyst at <a class="fork" href="http://www.bibl.ulaval.ca/"
                    >Universite Laval Library</a> in Canada. My daily work involves Java
                technologies and XML. After being seen as a microsoft employee/advocate for a long time, now
                most people think I am an Open source/Unix only guy...</p>
            <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:yveszoundi@users.sf.net">yveszoundi at users DOT sf DOT net</a>.</p>
