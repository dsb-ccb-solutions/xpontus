					<td>Provide an outline view of the code structure</td>
					<td>Work in progress - I will use <a class = "fork" href= "http://jedit.org">Jedit</a> sidekick plugin for now. When I will have a better understanding of Antlr I will use it.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Add a schema generator/converter (XML, XML Schema, DTD, Relax NG)</td>
					<td>Work in progress</td>

			<p>If you can help with translations in German, Spanish or any other language, please send me an email at yveszoundi at users dot sf dot net. I am using babelfish for translations :-). I am struggling with Antlr and syntax higlighting. If you have experience with it and want to contribute, I would be glad to hear from you.

</p>

			<p>The 1.0.0RC2 release is planned for the end of August. I will try to integrate Antlr before the end of the year.</p>
