            XPontus aims to become the free alternative to
            commercial XML IDES such as XMLSPy or Oxygen XML Editor, or Exchanger XML Editor without the Entreprise features for now. The application tries to provide you most of the features you would expect to see in a fully bloated XML IDE, in a familiar and conviviable manner.</p>
